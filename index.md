# Who am I?

![photo](./Icon-203pix.jpg) I am a retired professional of the space and aeronautics industry. My current technical center of interest is the blockchain and Earth Observation. I am certified Ethereum developer by ConsenSys Academy<br> [My LinkedIn Profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kvutien/). <br>[My Github Repositories](https://github.com/kvutien) <br>[My Vision: Machu Picchu, Tech4Good](https://kvutien-yes.medium.com/machu-picchu-how-the-blockchain-can-help-persons-in-need-8396820d13d1)
# My Github account
My Github account is composed of 4 types of repositories
1. **Project** repositories: contain the code of past hackathons where Mach Picchu participated (not maintained) or the code of Machu Picchu demos (maintained)
2. **Tutorial** repositories: contain forked tutorials or tutorials I wrote myself. They should be running as-is. Simply fork and clone them, following the instructions.
3. **Reference** repositories: contain industry reference repositories. I forked them in order to be able to do changes. Most of them contain tutorials that can be outdated, and I need to update them, for them to run.
4. **Explore** repositories: contain forked repositories that I might explore in detail some day. Once I make them work, they will be promoted to "tutorials"

All repositories have one of the 4 prefixes in the description. Your interest is most certainly in the tutorial repositories.
# About Machu Picchu
## The vision of Machu Picchu
![Machu Picchu Logo](64x64_logo.png) Machu Picchu is my current project. The vision of Machu Picchu is as follows:

### The problem:
* All organizations that support the persons in need worldwide complain that their data concerning these persons are isolated, inconsistent, not up to date and expensive to maintain. Ideally it should be accurate and shared among all helper organizations, and GDPR-compliant. See [White Paper of Mercy Corp, Danish Red Cross and Hive Online](https://www.hivenetwork.online/blockchain-for-good/)
* These organizations also complain that the current banking compliancy rules (FATF) are too heavy to make profitable the banking of people who have less than 50 USD revenues per month, and make excessive overhead for the Cash and Voucher Assistance (CVA) prgrams.

### The solution:
* Machu Picchu allows each person in need to own and maintain their own profile data. The technical details are described below.
* The profile data are available to all organizations, humanitarian or commercial, who use them to optimize their assistance programmes. They will pay a micro-fee (a token) to the owners to read these data.
* These organizations can also materialize their CVA as tokens under their own brand (UNICEF, Red Cross, World Food Programs etc.)
* The persons in need can exchange branded tokens among them to make a bundle of a single kind of token that is big enough to be worth being redeemed at a bank or at some official exchange.

## The advantages of Machu Picchu
The advantages are:
* Reporting of the usage of funds to donors is straightforward
* Ownership of the data remains in the hands of each person in need
* High quality of data
* Resilience to network disruption and to single storage failures
* Tokens are not cryptocurrencies. They are "units of trust" that can be redeemed against real cash at official financial services in amounts that justify the banking costs.


## How can it be done technically?
Almost all blockchain projects store the data on the blockchain. But for use cases that don't need double-spending protection, nor governance enforcement mechanisms, storing data on the blockchain is overkill. Transaction fees range between USD 0.50 and USD 300 (!).

IPFS (Interplanetary File System) and OrbitDB are decentralised storage solutions that have no data validation constraints. They just store the data. They use cryptography only to authenticate the owner (the person in need) and the consumer (assistance organizations) of the data. If we store the bulk of data on IPFS and on the blockchain only the public keys and the addresses of the smart contract that a person in need may invoke, the cost of registration of a person in need range between USD 0.50 to USD 3.00, which is affordable.

IPFS decentralised storage rules replicate the data between 20 peers or less. These peers may come and go. A [Raspberry Pi 3, small and faceless ARM computer on Linux](https://www.raspberrypi.org/about/), with 250 GB of storage costs USD 50 and can store data of 200 thousands persons at 1 MB each. This makes the system highly scalable to hundreds of millions of persons in need, by putting one Raspberry in every few villages or camps.

## How can it be done practically?
A person in need has at best a cellular phone. How can we give blockchain access to these people?

These people will access the blockchain through their chief of village, or equivalent, who has a blockchain enabled smartphone or tablet. This is a multisignature schema that has been prototyped by Machu Picchu in one hackathon. The cellular sends via SMS an information to populate the profile. This SMS will be approved by the chief of village on his or her smartphone or tablet. The transaction will be sent to IPFS for storage. Depending on the information, a trace may be stored or not on blockchain.

Once the habit of doing so is acquired, this multisignature can be extended to many other community usages: participation to common chores, incentive for good practice, education, decentralised exchange of tokens etc.

# What is the roadmap of Machu Picchu?

### The big picture
Mach Picchu is open source and collaborative. 
* The main thread of Machu Picchu is to derive from the Machu Picchu toolbox specific applications tailored to the needs of humanitarians and assistance organizations, and to deploy them on the field
* Based on the needs, the second thread of Machu Picchu is to build the toolbox that can be adapted to the user applications. However, this 2nd thread is anterior to the 1st thread in order to convince humanitarians that Machu Picchu is a reality and not just an idea.
* The third tread is to train people who are interested to use the Machu Picchu toolbox
* The last thread, external to Machu Picchu, is the core development of the decentralised technology

### Develop the Machu Picchu toolbox
The Machu Picchu toolbox is composed of several components
* demonstrators that can be derived into specific applications for humanitarians
* snippets of code that can be reused in the above as building bricks
* tutorials for new comers

### What is available today?
Machu Picchu is working on a demonstrator that implements the main components as described above

_To be done_
